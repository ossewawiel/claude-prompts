I have an existing [PROJECT_TYPE] project with no documentation. I need Claude Code to analyze the current state and help me understand the architecture.

Please analyze my codebase and:
1. Identify the technology stack and versions
2. Map out the project structure and architecture patterns
3. Document the data model and relationships
4. Identify the main features and functionality
5. Assess code quality and technical debt
6. Suggest improvements and missing documentation
