# Quick Project Analysis Prompt

Analyze this existing project and create PROJECT_SUMMARY.md with:

## Analysis Tasks:
1. **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, databases, versions
2. **Architecture**: Structure type, module organization, key components  
3. **Features**: Current functionality, external integrations
4. **Development**: Build process, testing, deployment commands
5. **Standards**: Code organization, security, patterns used

## Output Format:
Single markdown file with sections:
- Project Overview (name, type, primary language)
- Technology Stack (core tech, database, build tools, key dependencies)
- Architecture Overview (structure, components, entry points)
- Current Features (functionality, integrations)
- Development Standards (code org, testing, security)
- Build & Deployment (process, commands, environment)
- Claude Code Integration Recommendations

Focus on documenting what exists - no code changes. Include specific versions and actual commands that work.
