# Technical Debt Remediation Project Plan Generator

## CONTEXT
- **Purpose**: Generate executable step-by-step remediation plan from technical debt analysis
- **Input**: Completed `TECHNICAL_DEBT_ANALYSIS.md` document
- **Output**: Prioritized project plan with individual Claude Code prompts for each step
- **Approach**: Break down complex migrations into atomic, executable tasks

---

## PHASE 1: TECHNICAL DEBT PRIORITIZATION ANALYSIS

### Step 1: Parse Technical Debt Analysis
Using the completed `TECHNICAL_DEBT_ANALYSIS.md`, extract and categorize all identified technical debt items:

**Categorization Framework:**
```yaml
critical_security:
  - CVE vulnerabilities with known exploits
  - End-of-life technologies with no security support
  - Dependencies with critical security patches available

high_impact_performance:
  - Framework bottlenecks affecting user experience
  - Database versions with significant performance improvements
  - Build tools causing development slowdowns

maintainability_blockers:
  - Deprecated APIs preventing new feature development
  - Compatibility issues causing development friction
  - Missing features requiring extensive workarounds

compliance_gaps:
  - Technologies preventing regulatory compliance
  - Missing security standards implementation
  - Outdated cryptographic implementations
```

### Step 2: Create Dependency Impact Map
Analyze interdependencies between technical debt items to determine execution order:

1. **Dependency Chain Analysis**
   - Identify which upgrades must happen before others
   - Map breaking change impacts across the stack
   - Identify independent upgrade paths

2. **Risk Assessment per Item**
   - Estimate complexity and potential for regression
   - Identify items that can be done independently
   - Flag items requiring coordinated changes
