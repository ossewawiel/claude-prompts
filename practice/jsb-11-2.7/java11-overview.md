- Database performance tuning and query optimization
- JVM tuning and memory management
- Security implementation (input validation, encryption, rate limiting)
- Monitoring and observability (metrics, tracing, health checks)
- Data privacy and GDPR compliance

## Key Principles Covered

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each service class should have one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Injection** - Use constructor injection with Lombok @RequiredArgsConstructor
3. **Immutability** - Prefer immutable DTOs and value objects using @Value and @Builder
4. **Clean Code** - Follow meaningful naming conventions and comprehensive documentation
5. **Error Handling** - Implement robust exception strategies with proper propagation
6. **Testing** - Ensure high test coverage with meaningful unit and integration tests
7. **Performance** - Optimize through caching, async processing, and efficient queries
8. **Security** - Implement comprehensive security measures and data protection
9. **Monitoring** - Add observability through metrics, logging, and health checks
10. **Async Operations** - Leverage modern async patterns and proper thread management

## Technology Stack Covered

- **Java 11** - Latest LTS features and performance improvements
- **Spring Boot 2.7.x** - Latest stable version with comprehensive feature set
- **Lombok** - Code generation and boilerplate reduction
- **MapStruct** - Efficient compile-time mapping generation
- **JUnit 5** - Modern testing framework with advanced features
- **Mockito** - Mocking framework for unit testing
- **Micrometer** - Application metrics and monitoring
- **Spring Cache** - Caching abstraction with multiple providers
- **Spring Security** - Comprehensive security framework
- **Async Processing** - CompletableFuture and reactive programming
